Bubble-Breaker
==============

My take at an assignment that I found on a web programming class. I did this one because I wanted to learn javscript 
and I found it to be a great way to learn the basics and how to manipulate the DOM.

The goal of the game is to clear out groups of bubbles until there are only isolated bubbles left. 
The bigger the groups you pick, the higher your score will be. Good luck!
